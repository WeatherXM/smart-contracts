# WeatherXM
[![CI](https://github.com/WeatherXM/smart-contracts-v2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/WeatherXM/smart-contracts-v2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Coverage](https://github.com/WeatherXM/smart-contracts-v2/actions/workflows/coverage.yml/badge.svg?branch=feat%2Fadd-coverage-badges)](https://github.com/WeatherXM/smart-contracts-v2/actions/workflows/coverage.yml)

This repo contains all contracts and tests relevant to WeatherXM network. WeatherXM is a community powered weather network, that rewards weather station owners and provides accurate weather services to Web3 enterprises.

## Branches

- `releases` contain complete, tested and audited contract code, generally on mainnet
- `main` contains complete, tested and audited contract code, generally on mumbai, to support beta users
- `develop` is for the pre-release code, with new features, not yet audited

## Architecture

As more logic is transferred into smart contracts, a need for grouping of functionality and modularity emerges. That is why multiple Smart Contracts are now created, each with its own logic and design patterns:

- [WeatherXM](./docs/weatherxm)
- WeatherStationXM
- [RewardPool](./docs/rewardpool)
- [ServicePool](./docs/servicepool)

Diagrams illustrating the interaction among the smart contracts, storage slots, classes, etc can be found in [diagrams](./docs/diagrams).

### Assumptions

- Different Admins can be assigned to each contract after deployment to the network by assigning roles.
- Admin has a lot of power and is assumed to be the right, fair, and just person/party. It is highly advised to have a multisig as admin, rather than just an EOA.
- The entire supply of tokens is minted upon deployment to the deployer of the token. The deployer is then responsible for transferring the tokens to the correct wallets after the deployment. These wallets will include vestings, rewards, and any other allocation as described in the white paper and tokens emissions section in the docs [Token Emissions](./docs/emissions)

### Rules

- Fund RewardPool every day with the daily amount of rewards to be claimed ([Token Emissions](./docs/emissions.md)).
- The daily rewards are calculated externally by the rewarding mechanism and then a merkle tree root hash is submitted to the RewardPool
- Submitting the root hash once per day.
- Tokens in circulation should never be more than maximum supply (100M).
- The total sum of tokens in the RewardPool must always be enough for everyone to claim their full allocation.
- Available rewards to be claimed for each user are calculated based on the parameters, cumulative amount, the user's wallet address, the cycle and the Merkle proof and the amount of rewards already claimed.
- A user cannot claim more than their toal allocated rewards in the RewardPool.
- The maximum amount a user can claim is constrained by the chosen cycle and the provided Merkle proof, so it is advised to use the proof for the latest cycle.
- In each cycle, each user has only one valid proof.
- Anyone can buy services through the ServicePool contract.
- Proof of purchase (a transaction hash of the transaction from the service purchase through ServicePool) is required for the provision of services
- The remaining tokens from the rewarding fo all weather stations in a daily basis are transferred to the [Bussiness Development pool](./docs/pools.md)

### Merkle Tree and Claiming Rewards

You may find more info about the implementation of Merkle Tree and the procedure which enables claiming of rewards in the [docs](./docs/merkle_tree.md).

### Supply-And-Demand Equilibrium

The $WXM token is designed to distribute the value accrued by the commercial use of WeatherXM data to the Network participants. In other words, there is supply (new issuance) and demand (token used to purchase services due to commercial uses of the Networkâ€™s data which are put back in the rewards pool) for $WXM, and eventually, an equilibrium point is reached.

The only case in which issuance of new tokens can stop is if the maximum supply of 100 million tokens is reached (expected to happen in more than 10 years) and there is zero demand for Network data (i.e. token burns), or if the DAO, which will be in place by then, decides to change the token issuance policy.

#### Purchasing services

Tokens that are used to purchase services are sent back into the rewards pool and remain locked there to be claimed by users during the daily rewards allocation. Services are also purchasable using stablecoins which will then be used for WXM buy-back (schedule for buyback will be done in a transparent way and be controlled by the DAO) that will end up in the rewards pool.

#### Putting tokens back into circulation

Tokens will be put into circulation based on the emissions described in the tokenomics section of the [Whitepaper](https://weatherxm.com/token/)

## Dev Notes

### Testing

Tests are written with Foundry, Hardhat, Ethers & Typescript, using Typechain to generate typings for all contracts.

Please make sure:

1. Install the project's dependencies.

```
npm run setup
```

2. Review **hardhat.config.ts** and **hardhat-fork.config.ts** to better undestand the configuration of testnets and dependencies

3. Review the **env.template** to make sure you provide all necessary information for testing

4. Test the smart contracts by choosing one of the options described in this [tutorial](./docs/testing.md)

### CI

Codebase rules are enforced through some passing GitHub Actions (workflow configs are in .github/workflows). These rules are:

- Linting of both the contracts (through Solhint) and TS files (ESLint)
- Compile the smart contracts successfully
- Passing testing suites (both for Foundry and Hardhat)

### Code Formatting & Documentation

- Solidity imports deconstructed as import { xxx } from "../xxx.sol"
- Designed for Solidity >=0.8.20
- Uses custom errors instead of revert reason strings
- Well-documented via NatSpec comments
- Thoroughly tested with Foundry and Hardhat

Detailed code documentation resulted from NatSpec comments can be found in [Code Documentation](./docs/index.md).

### Security

While we have strict standards for code quality and test coverage, it's important to note that this project may not be entirely risk-free. Although we have taken measures to ensure the security of the contracts, they have not yet been audited by a third-party security researcher.
