#### After day 1,095

After day 1,095 (3 years after the launch), the Company will receive no more rewards. Up to 14,246 tokens will be issued daily, as long as there are less than 100 million tokens in circulation. Any tokens that will be issued will be used to reward station owners.
14,246 will be used daily to reward station owners

Note that there is no end date for token issuance. On any given day (after day 1,095), if the total supply is less than 100 million, then 14K new tokens will be issued.

At this rate, a total of 100 million tokens would be issued in ~10 years. However, since tokens are also burned, reaching the maximum supply cap will take longer than 10 years.
