# Token Pools

## Company & Investors Pool

WeatherXM AG (and its investors) will be rewarded for the services they provide to the Network (including hardware design and delivery, infrastructure, R&D, operations, mobile apps, user support, data refinement, and other) with daily rewards totalling to 30M $WXM tokens over a period of 3 years. In the context of Ethereum norms, this is a conservative allocation to the Company, to preserve space for other important stakeholders.

## Business Development Pool

The daily token emissions and rewards described above assume an environment in which each participant station achieves a perfect quality score – where there are the optimal number of stations in a cell, stations have perfect uptime and data quality is optimal. But in reality, this is not the case. When network conditions are suboptimal, some amount of $WXM rewards, otherwise due to station operators, may be withheld. Such tokens are collected in the Business Development Pool.

Tokens in this pool can only be used for business development, providing the funds to incentivise or subsidise business use cases without affecting token emissions. For example this pool enables ad-hoc, time-limited reward boosters to influence network roll-out in areas with more business opportunities and to identify optimum reward strategies. As the market matures and the Network evolves, ad-hoc business development strategies implemented using this pool will be integrated into the rewards mechanism.

The Network assigns the Company the management of the Business Development Pool. This decision can be revoked by a $WXM majority vote after transitioning to a DAO. Tokens in this pool cannot vote.

## Ecosystem Development Pool

10M $WXM tokens are reserved to fund special community projects that promote ecosystem development such as grants, bounties and hackathons. This pool will also be used for the DAO/Foundation transition.

These tokens will be minted upon deployment of the ERC20 smart contract.

## Liquidity Bootstrap Pool

5M $WXM tokens will be used to provide the necessary liquidity for the $WXM token.

These tokens will be minted upon deployment of the ERC20 smart contract.

## Beta rewards (“airdrop”)

3 million tokens will be used to reward stations that contributed data to the Network during the beta phase. This is not a marketing activity intended to create buzz and awareness, but a reward mechanism for the stations that participated and formed the Network before a reward mechanism was in place.

These tokens will be minted upon deployment of the ERC20 smart contract.

Beta rewards will be allocated according to the number of days a station has provided valid data to the network during the testnet/beta period. The number of days contributed by each station during the beta period will be calculated using the latest rewards mechanism implemented at the time of the token launch and applied retrospectively to the data the stations provided during the beta period.

Beta rewards will be distributed to beneficiaries gradually on top of the rewards they would normally receive for operating their stations, until all beta rewards allocated to them are distributed.

For example, a station that provided data for 100 days before the token launch, will receive their beta rewards throughout the first 100 days after the token launch.
